# This is the OpenImporter development repository.

OpenImporter was inspired by SMF's forum converter engine and attempts to "convert" data between different forum systems. The importer assumes you have installed one of the supported destination systems and that your installation of that system is working properly. It copies data from a source system into the destination plattform, so it won't work without an installation of the selected destination.

## Supported Source systems

## Development notes

The development happens on two branches: *master* and *development*.

The *master* branch holds the current most stable version of OpenImporter. If you want to do a conversion this is the one to use (unless your system is not supported).
The *development* branch contains the most "advanced" (in terms of refactoring and "moving-forward" ideas) code, but it's very unstable and can be badly broken.

### Using master code

In order to use the code from the master branch, download it and upload the files to your host. Point the browser to the path where OpenImporter is to *import.php* and follow the instructions.

### Using development code

The code in the development branch relies on a number of external dependencies, that must be installed before using OpenImporter.
External dependencies are handled by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), follow this procedure to have OpenImporter up and running:
- Install Composer ([instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx))
- Download OpenImporter package (either downloading the HEAD from github, or cloning the repository)
- From the command line go to the OpenImporter directory
- Run the command ```composer install```
- OpenImporter is ready to be used
